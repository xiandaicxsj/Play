this is filesystem read

1. data_buffer
	tmp memory used for store content read from the hd
2. inode
	block_list /* used for store the block id of certain */

3. super_block	
	inode_num;	

4. inode_bitmap

5. block_bitmap


(1)/* blk realted */
1. register_blk_device(u32 dev_num, struct device_ops *)

2. blk_read (change block to ...) -> device_read

3. blk_write(change block to ...)

	sturct device_ops {
		device_reset();
		device_read(u32 dev_num, u32 block_num, void *buffer);
		device_write(u32 dev_num, u32 block_num, void *buffer);
	}
(2)/* fs realted */

stcut fs {

}
/* we only use block to write/read blk device */
it means when perform read
	1. search block
	2. read_blk to fill the block
	3. copy to certain mem need this block
	4. write is the same.

init_block_cache():
	/* use hash to deter  whether the block is in the cache */

	1. block/hash_size -> link_list (lru);
		the page cache in the list should be lru.
	2. when but how is the 

	/* can do it after */
	3. need a sync point to write back the dirty page cache.

init_super_block():
	1. get_superblock_info from disk
	2. init_inode/block map in the mem_supoer_block
		-read inode/block map in the blk
	/* do I need it */
	3. add file_ops in the vfs

	
sys_fs_open();
sys_fs_read();
sys_fs_write();

1./* page cache */
	page : this page only used for blk 
	size : 4K

2. 


/* 
   1. block cache is a lot of pages need to cache block data, nowsdays it should not map in the use cr3 part(But use mmap in the furture may need this)
   2. current page used for process (not file uses) need not to write/back???
	for 2 may be swap need this ????
	yes swap is need
*/
need to think how to del with dirty bit of ...
1. dirty bit
2. device and driver blk seperate
